```

## Configuration & Environment Variables

To configure the system, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub. It is already listed in `.gitignore` for your safety.

The `.env.example` file contains all necessary configuration keys, including database, web server, security, DuckDNS, and backup settings.

## Editing Your .env File

The `.env` file contains sensitive configuration for your SBMS system. Here’s how to edit it safely:

1. **Copy the example file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. **Open `.env` in your editor:**
   You can use VS Code, nano, vim, or any text editor.
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
3. **Fill in your values:**
   - Database credentials: Choose strong passwords. [Password generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/)
   - Secret keys: Use a secure random string. [Random key generator](https://randomkeygen.com/)
   - DuckDNS: Get your token and domain from [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/)
   - Backup path: Make sure the path exists and is writable.
   - HTTPS: For production, set `ENABLE_HTTPS=true` and follow [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for free SSL certificates.

4. **Do not share your `.env` file!**
   - Never commit `.env` to GitHub or share it publicly.
